About Umbra

Umbra is an efficient and scalable memory shadowing framework built on
top of DynamoRIO, a dynamic instrumentation tool platform. Umbra
employs a novel translation scheme, which supports efficient mapping
from application data to shadow metadata for 64-bit
applications. Umbra's translation scheme does not rely on any platform 
features and is not restricted to any specific shadow memory size.
